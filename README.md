# Retail Sales Analysis â€“ SQL Project

This project performs **end-to-end data analysis** on a retail sales dataset using **MySQL**. It demonstrates **data cleaning, exploration, and solving key business problems** using SQL queries. The goal is to derive actionable insights such as **top customers, best-selling categories, seasonal trends, and profit margins**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

- **Database Used:** MySQL  
- **Dataset:** Retail sales transactions (customer demographics, sales amount, category, quantity, etc.)  
- **Objective:** Analyze sales data to answer business questions like:
  - Which categories generate maximum revenue?
  - Who are the top customers?
  - What are the best selling months and peak sales hours?
  - What is the profit margin per category?

## Steps Performed

# 1. Database Creation & Table Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p2;
USE sql_project_p2;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
   transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   sale_date DATE,
   sale_time TIME,
   customer_id INT,
   gender VARCHAR(15),
   age INT,
   category VARCHAR(15),
   quantity INT,
   price_per_unit FLOAT,
   cogs FLOAT,
   total_sale FLOAT
);


#data cleaning

select * from 
retail_sales
where 
	transactions_id is null
      or
	sale_date is null
      or
	sale_time is null
  or
  customer_id is null
  or
   gender is null
   or
   age is null
   or

   or
   quantity	 is null
   or
   price_per_unit is null
     or
   cogs is null
   or
   total_sale is null;

#data exploration
select count(*) as total_sales from retail_sales;

select count(distinct customer_id) as customers from retail_sales;
select * from  retail_sales;

-- Data Analysis & Business Key Problems & Answers

-- My Analysis & Findings
-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
 select count(distinct customer_id)
from retail_sales
where sale_date = "2022-11-05";







-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022




SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11'
  AND quantity>= 4;

#another method
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND extract(MONTH from sale_date ) = '11'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = '2022'
  AND quantity>= 4;










--# Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

 
 
 SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

select category, sum(total_sale),
count(*) as total_orders
 from retail_sales
 group by category;

select  avg(age)
from retail_sales
where category = 'Beauty';







-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.




select * 
   from retail_sales
   where total_sale>1000;

-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 35 THEN 'Young Adult'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN 'Adult'
    ELSE 'Senior'
  END AS age_group,
  SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
